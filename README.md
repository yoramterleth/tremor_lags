# tremor_lags

This code repository accompanies a manuscript submitted to *Journal of Glaciology*. 

Code repository for the compution of lag times between coherent glacio-hydraulic tremor series acquired through a network of independent seismic stations. Utilizes the matlab wavelet coherence tools (https://www.mathworks.com/help/wavelet/ug/compare-time-frequency-content-in-signals-with-wavelet-coherence.html) Can be used to process the output of the med_spec scripts collection (https://github.com/tbartholomaus/med_spec). 
A more detialed description is forthcoming.
